    <h1>URL Shortener</h1>
    <p>The URL Shortener is a simple web application that allows you to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. It's built using Python and a web framework like Flask.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Shorten long URLs into concise, easy-to-share links.</li>
        <li>Optionally customize the shortened URL for branding or readability.</li>
        <li>Access detailed statistics about the shortened URL's usage, like the number of clicks.</li>
        <li>API support for programmatically shortening URLs.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>1. Clone the repository to your local machine:</p>
    <pre><code>https://github.com/Adi-spec-gif/Url_Shortner</code></pre>
    <p>2. Install the necessary dependencies using pip:</p>
    <pre><code>pip install flask</code></pre>
    <p>3. Run the Python script to start the URL shortener application:</p>
    <pre><code>python app.py</code></pre>
    <p>4. Access the URL shortener interface by opening a web browser and navigating to <a href="http://localhost:5000">http://localhost:5000</a> or the address provided by your Flask app.</p>
    <p>5. Enter a long URL to shorten and click the "Shorten" button.</p>
    <p>6. Optionally customize the shortened URL and access detailed statistics for each link.</p>
    <p>7. You can also use the API to programmatically shorten URLs by sending a POST request with the long URL.</p>

   <h2>Customization</h2>
    <p>You can customize the URL shortener by modifying the code and improving the user interface. Consider implementing additional features like password-protected links or expiration dates for the shortened URLs.</p>

  <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
